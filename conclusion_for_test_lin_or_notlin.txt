output of problem:

-->To test your data either linear or not linear with the help of single perceptron learning


The output of test_for_lin_or_notlin.py file is:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
epected output --->1
perceptron output is ---> 1
---------------------------
epected output --->0
perceptron output is ---> 0
---------------------------
epected output --->1
perceptron output is ---> 1
final weights --> [-0.01  0.01  0.01  0.    0.03]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As per output We can see that ,for theshold =7 and learning_rate =0.01 
our single perceptron is trained and fit well on training data.

And As per this output we can give conclusion that our data is linear as single perceptron fit well on data.
